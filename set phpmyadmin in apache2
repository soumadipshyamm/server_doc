To set up phpMyAdmin on an Apache2 web server, follow these steps. This guide assumes you have a working Apache2 server and PHP installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install phpMyAdmin

1. **Update Package Index:**
   First, update your package index:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install phpMyAdmin:**
   Install phpMyAdmin using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install phpmyadmin
   ```

   During the installation, you will be prompted to choose the web server that should be automatically configured to run phpMyAdmin. Select **Apache** by pressing the `Space` bar and then `Enter`.

3. **Configure Database:**
   You will also be asked if you want to use `dbconfig-common` to set up the database. Choose **Yes** and provide the necessary database administrative credentials when prompted.

### Step 2: Configure Apache to Serve phpMyAdmin

1. **Create a Configuration File:**
   If the installation did not automatically create a configuration file, you can create one manually. Open or create a new configuration file for phpMyAdmin:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration to the file:

   ```apache
   Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin

   <Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
       DirectoryIndex index.php
       AllowOverride All
       Require all granted
   </Directory>

   <Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin/setup>
       <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
           <RequireAny>
               Require all granted
           </RequireAny>
       </IfModule>
   </Directory>
   ```

2. **Enable the Configuration:**
   Enable the phpMyAdmin configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo a2enconf phpmyadmin
   ```

### Step 3: Restart Apache

After making the changes, restart Apache to apply the configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 4: Secure phpMyAdmin (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to secure your phpMyAdmin installation. You can do this by adding an additional layer of authentication.

1. **Create a Password File:**
   Use the `htpasswd` utility to create a password file. If you don’t have `apache2-utils` installed, install it first:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2-utils
   ```

   Create the password file and add a user:

   ```bash
   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd username
   ```

   Replace `username` with your desired username. You will be prompted to enter a password.

2. **Update the phpMyAdmin Configuration:**
   Edit the phpMyAdmin configuration file again:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf
   ```

   Add the following lines inside the `<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>` block:

   ```apache
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Restricted Access"
   AuthUserFile /etc/phpmyadmin/.htpasswd
   Require valid-user
   ```

3. **Restart Apache Again:**
   Restart Apache to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

### Step 5: Access phpMyAdmin

Now, you can access phpMyAdmin by navigating to:

```
http://your-server-ip/phpmyadmin
```

Replace `your-server-ip` with your server's IP address or domain name.
